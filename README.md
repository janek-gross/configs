# Vimrc

Vim is a great text editor and a poweful coding tool. With the provided functionality it can even serve as a lightweight IDE.
This repository contains my personalized .vimrc configuration file. Since vim is already installed on many systems downloading the configuration file is a simple and fast way to retreive my settings on new systems.
